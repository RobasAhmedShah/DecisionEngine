## üéØ **Core Decision Engine Features**

### 1. **üîç Multi-Factor Risk Assessment Engine**

**Functionality:** Comprehensive evaluation of 15+ risk factors in real-time

**Key Capabilities:**
- Unified risk scoring across all assessment dimensions
- Real-time risk categorization (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL)
- Transparent scoring methodology with detailed breakdowns
- Integration with multiple data sources

**Banker Questions Addressed:**
- *"How long does it take your team to manually review each credit card application?"*
- *"How many different systems do you need to check for a single application?"*

**Technical Implementation:**
- Weighted scoring algorithm with configurable weights
- Real-time data aggregation from multiple sources
- Automated risk band assignment based on score thresholds

---

### 2. **üìä Advanced Debt-to-Income (DBR) Analysis**

**Functionality:** Sophisticated DBR calculation following SBP Prudential Regulation R-3

**Key Capabilities:**
- Automated obligation aggregation (existing loans, credit cards, overdrafts)
- Dynamic threshold calculation based on customer profile
- Age-based DBR overrides for customers over 65
- Real-time compliance with SBP thresholds (PASS ‚â§40%, CONDITIONAL ‚â§50%, FAIL >50%)

**Banker Questions Addressed:**
- *"How do you currently calculate DBR? Do you manually add up all existing obligations?"*
- *"How often do DBR calculations contain errors due to missing obligations?"*

**Implemented Rules & Reasoning:**

**Rule 1: DBR Calculation Formula**
```
DBR = (Total Monthly Obligations / Net Disposable Monthly Income) √ó 100
```
**Why:** SBP Prudential Regulation R-3 mandates this exact formula for credit risk assessment.

**Rule 2: Obligation Components**
- Existing Monthly Obligations: Direct debt payments
- Credit Card Component: 5% of existing credit card limits
- Overdraft Component: Annual interest √∑ 12 months
- Proposed EMI: 0 for credit cards (limit doesn't create monthly obligation)
**Why:** Credit cards don't create monthly EMI obligations, only existing debt affects DBR.

**Rule 3: Threshold Bands**
- PASS: ‚â§40% (Low risk)
- CONDITIONAL: 41-50% (Medium risk, requires review)
- FAIL: >50% (High risk, automatic decline)
**Why:** Credit cards are unsecured lending requiring stricter DBR limits than secured loans.

**Rule 4: Age Override**
- Customers over 65: Special consideration with reduced thresholds
**Why:** Retirement income patterns differ from active employment income.

**Sample Output:**
```
DBR Analysis: 88.57%
Components ‚Üí Existing: PKR 25,000, CC(5%): PKR 5,000, OD/12: PKR 1,000
Total Obligations: PKR 31,000
Net Income: PKR 35,000
Status: FAIL (exceeds 50% threshold)
```

**Technical Implementation:**
- SBP R-3 compliant calculation methodology
- Component-wise obligation breakdown

- Automatic card type assignment

**Banker Questions Addressed:**
- *"How do you determine the appropriate credit limit for each customer?"*
- *"How do you ensure compliance with SBP regulatory caps across all applications?"*

**Implemented Rules & Reasoning:**

**Rule 1: Card Type Ranges**
- SILVER: PKR 25,000 - 125,000 (Entry-level customers)
- GOLD: PKR 125,001 - 299,999 (Mid-tier customers)

```
**Why:** Ensures compliance with all constraints simultaneously.

**Rule 4: Income-based Limit**
- ETB: 4.5x net monthly income
- NTB: 4.0x net monthly income
**Why:** ETB customers have proven relationship, allowing higher leverage.
